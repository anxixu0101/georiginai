## Origin: An allergic reaction
I worked as a robotics algorithm engineer for three years. Because of the fast pace of our work, I was often worried about my health, so I bought an Apple Watch to monitor my sleep and heart rate. Without a doubt, it's one of the best electronic gadgets I've ever bought. Unfortunately, I sweat a lot, so after wearing the watch all day, my wrist would often become extremely itchy and even a little red and swollen. This redness and swelling was even worse when I wore it all night to monitor my sleep. I tried changing the watch band, but it didn't seem to help much. So I started thinking about whether it would be possible to create a contactless heart rate monitoring device.

## Soooo，Let's just do it

I bought some commercially available millimeter-wave radar modules and corresponding circuit boards and assembled them. Although they looked bulky, they could perform simple heart rate and respiration monitoring, which made me think that contactless heart rate monitoring might actually be possible. However, I didn't want it to be a bulky circuit board. So I asked my friend, an electronics engineer, and we worked together to design a relatively simple circuit board, just enough to make the millimeter-wave radar work properly and display the heart rate. My goal wasn't ambitious.

## We designed a relatively lightweight and compact prototype

It took my friend about two weeks to design the circuit (he also works at his company during the day, dealing with his incredibly annoying boss). I wrote the code, and after some simple debugging, it worked perfectly. I then found a friend who is a mechanical engineer, and he drew a simple casing for me and 3D printed it out to make it look less rudimentary.

## Let's mail BioZero to our online friends overseas for testing!

I named my prototype BioZero, and I desperately needed international users to witness my innovation. This is because I needed more objective feedback, and also because I've never left Asia (I'm in China, and I've only been to Japan). If BioZero could take me to see other parts of the world, that would be incredibly exciting. A user from Slovenia contacted me on Reddit, expressing his willingness to review it. Some time after I mailed the BioZero out, I received a very detailed review email from him, filled with his many suggestions. I am extremely grateful to him. Once again, I'm amazed by the magic of the internet!

## Next steps

To make BioZero a more complete product, I hired a designer to create a very creative design, and I've decided to name the next generation BioZero Easing-Point. This is because I want it to not only display heart rate but also provide simple sedentary reminders. On the algorithm side, I'm rewriting an algorithm to make the heart rate display more stable and accurate.
