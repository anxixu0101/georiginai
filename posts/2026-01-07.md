# I replaced the millimeter-wave radar sensor and hired a new designer to redesign the exterior

## Summary of the shortcomings of the open-source demos

Based on my repeated testing, the prototype you saw in the video still has many problems. For example, it's slow to react, and the maximum heart rate it can measure is 100. The problem of the maximum heart rate measurement value is easily solved; I replaced the millimeter-wave radar chip, and that resolved the issue. The second reason I had to replace the millimeter-wave radar chip is that the one used in the prototype didn't seem to be FCC certified, while the one I replaced it with is FCC certified, which gives me peace of mind. And I purchased the official baseplate to perform basic sensor testing.

## New millimeter-wave radar test

The detection of heart rate, respiration, and human presence works flawlessly, and the official GUI software displays heart rate curves well. However, inherent limitations of the millimeter-wave radar sensor remain: high latency, susceptibility to vibration, and while heart rate values ​​are accurate at certain times, there are still unusual fluctuations. These appear to be issues I'll need to address using algorithms. What's more frustrating is that the GUI software isn't open-source, meaning I'll have to implement the algorithm myself if I need to output heart rate curves. However, this isn't a major problem.

## New product appearance design

Actually, I'm quite picky about appearances, but I have no design skills myself, so I hired a professional designer to design the Easing-Point's appearance. In my opinion, the users of the Easing-Point are people who sit for long periods using laptops, often neglecting to get up and relax because they're so focused on work. Therefore, the Easing-Point should be a device that simply plugs into a laptop's Type-C port. The reason for this design is twofold: firstly, it's very simple to use; secondly, designing it with a battery from the start would greatly increase our development burden, given our small team. So, it's better to start with a simple Type-C interface to test its functionality.

I created a few rough mockups using AI, but the final product will definitely have a higher quality feel than the AI-generated ones. My designer should give me a design version in a few days, at which time I will review it.
